[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) / [NeoVim](https://neovim.io) is a powerful and highly configurable text editor designed to make text manipulation and coding a breeze. It's known for its unique modal editing system, where different modes offer distinct functionalities like insertion, navigation, and text manipulation. This design philosophy enables lightning-fast editing once you're familiar with the concepts.

## Troubleshooting üîß

The installation is not working:

* Make sure you have Git installed on your computer.
  Open the terminal and run the following command:
  ```bash
  git --version
  ```
  If Git is installed, you will see the installed version. If not, you need to install it using your package manager.
  Then retry the Installation.
  
* Check if a file/directory already exists
  
  **Linux & MacOS**
  
  Check if the `~/.config/nvim` , `~/Vim_Config` or `~/.vimrc` already exists.
  Open the terminal and run the following command to check if they exists:

  - To check if the `~/.config/nvim` directory exists, run:
      ```bash
      ls ~/.config/nvim
      ```
      Is found, run:
      ```bash
      mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim_backup
      ```
  - To check if the `~/Vim_Config` directory exists, run:
      ```bash
      ls ~/Vim_Config
      ```
      Is found, run:
      ```bash
      mv ~/Vim_Config ~/Vim_Config_backup
      ```
  - To check if the `~/.vimrc` file exists, run:
      ```bash
      cat ~/.vimrc
      ```
      Is found, run:
      ```bash
      mv ~/.vimrc ~/.vimrc_backup
      ```

  **Windows**
  
  Check if the `$HOME\AppData\Local\nvim` , `$HOME\Vim_Config` or `$HOME\.vimrc` already exists.
  Open PowerShell and run the following command to check if they exists:

  - To check if the `$HOME\AppData\Local\nvim` directory exists, run:
      ```pwsh
      dir $HOME\AppData\Local\nvim
      ```
      Is found, run:
      ```pwsh
      mv $HOME\AppData\Local\nvim $HOME\AppData\Local\nvim_backup
      ```
  - To check if the `$HOME\Vim_Config` directory exists, run:
      ```pwsh
      dir $HOME\Vim_Config
      ```
      Is found, run:
      ```pwsh
      mv $HOME\Vim_Config $HOME\Vim_Config_backup
      ```
  - To check if the `$HOME\.vimrc` file exists, run:
      ```pwsh
      cat $HOME\.vimrc
      ```
      Is found, run:
      ```pwsh
      mv $HOME\.vimrc $HOME\.vimrc_backup
      ```
  This will rename the existing directory/file as _backup.
  Retry the Installation.
